# 3D model - Socket extension holder
ðŸ–¨ 3D model of a 1/2" socket extension holder, includes parametric Fusion 360 file to modify for other types and sizes.

## Summary

My design for a socket extension holder to improve my workshop organisation, built specifically for my 1/2 inch socket extensions.

Included are the STL files and the Fusion 360 file, which uses parameters for all of the calculations, though this hasn't been tested on non-1/2 inch sizes.
